# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Project 1: Navigation

## Introduction

![Trained Agent][image1]

The files included in this repository implement a DQN agent capable of navigating a large square world with the goal of collecting yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.

The environment is similar to that of...

The mechanics of the envonment are as follows:

- *Rewards*: +1 for collecting a yellow banana, -1 for collecting a blue banana.
- *State space*: 37 dimensions (includes agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction)
- *Action space*: 4 discrete actions:
    - **`0`** - move forward
    - **`1`** - move backward
    - **`2`** - turn left
    - **`3`** - turn right

The environment is considered solved once the agent has an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.

2. Download the environment from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

3. Place the downloaded file in the folder you cloned this repo to and unzip (or decompress) the file.

4. Create a Python environment for this project. I recommend using `conda` or `venv`.

5. Activate that environment and install dependencies: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Instructions

1. Open the `Navigation.ipynb` notebook and adjust the path to the environment file based on its name and where you placed it.

2. You are ready to start interacting with the environment.

- Use the cells in sections 1, 2 and 3 to initialize and explore the environment
- Run the cells in section 4 to train the agent. Feel free to change the hyperparameters in `dqn_agent.py` to see if you can improve training.
- Run the cells in section 5 to test the agent.
